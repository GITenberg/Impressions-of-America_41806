<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="first">Oscar Wilde visited America
in the year 1882. Interest in the
Æsthetic School, of which he was already
the acknowledged master, had
sometime previously spread to the
United States, and it is said that the
production of the Gilbert and Sullivan
opera, “Patience,”<a id="Marker_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="marker">[1]</a> in which he
and his disciples were held up to
ridicule, determined him to pay a
visit to the States to give some lectures
explaining what he meant by
Æstheticism, hoping thereby to interest,
and possibly to instruct and
elevate our transatlantic cousins.</p>

<!--008.png-->

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_8" title="8">&nbsp;</a>
He set sail on board the “Arizona”
on Saturday, December 24th, 1881,
arriving in New York early in the
following year. On landing he was
bombarded by journalists eager to
interview the distinguished stranger.
“Punch,” in its issue of January 14th,
in a happy vein, parodied these interviewers,
the most amusing passage
in which referred to “His Glorious
Past,” wherein Wilde was made to
say, “Precisely&mdash;I took the Newdigate.
Oh! no doubt, every year some
man gets the Newdigate; but not
every year does Newdigate get an
Oscar.”</p>

<p>At Omaha, where, under the
auspices of the Social Art Club,
Wilde delivered a lecture on
“Decorative Art,” he described his
impressions of many American houses
as being “illy designed, decorated
shabbily, and in bad taste, filled with
furniture that was not honestly made,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_9" title="9">&nbsp;</a><!--009.png-->
and was out of character.” This
statement gave rise to the following
<span class="no-wrap">verses:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="line">Far from Piccadilly banished,</div>
<div class="line">He to Omaha has vanished.</div>
<div class="line i2">Horrid place, which swells ignore.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

<div class="line">Or great Hercules have died for,</div>
<div class="line i2">His knee breeches now display.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Waving sunflower and lily,</div>
<div class="line">He calls all the houses “illy</div>
<div class="line i2">Decorated and designed.”</div>

<div class="line">They may chew and they may whittle;</div>
<div class="line i2">But they’re all born colour-blind!</div>

His lectures dealt almost exclusively
with the subjects of Art and Dress
Reform. In the course of one lecture
he remarked that the most impressive
room he had yet entered in America
was the one in Camden Town where
he met Walt Whitman. It contained
plenty of fresh air and sunlight. On
the table was a simple cruse of water.
This led to a parody, in the style of
Whitman, describing an imaginary
interview between the two poets,
which appeared in “The Century”
a few months later. Wilde is
called Narcissus and Whitman
Paumanokides.</p>

</div>
</div>
<!--011.png-->

<div class="line i2">Strange sounds across the seas are blown,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="first">Of the lectures which he delivered
in America only one has been preserved,
namely that on the English
Renaissance. This was his first lecture,
and it was delivered in New
York on January 9th, 1882. According
to a contemporary account in the
“New York Herald” a distinguished
and crowded audience assembled in
Chickering Hall that evening to listen
to one who “was well worth seeing,
his short breeches and silk stockings
showing to even better advantage
upon the stage than in the gilded
drawing-rooms, where the young
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_12" title="12">&nbsp;</a><!--012.png-->
Apostle has heretofore been seen in
New York.”<a id="Marker_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="marker">[2]</a></p>

<p>On leaving the States in the “fall”
of the year Wilde proceeded to Canada
and thence to Nova Scotia, arriving in
Halifax in the second week of October.
Of his visit there we have no record
except an amusing interview described
in a local paper a few days later. He
was dressed in a velvet jacket with
an ordinary linen collar and neck tie
and he wore trousers. “Mr. Wilde,”
the interviewer states, “was communicative
and genial; he said he found
Canada pleasant, but in answer to a
question as to whether European or
American women were the more
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_13" title="13">&nbsp;</a><!--013.png-->
beautiful, he dexterously evaded his
querist.”</p>

<p>As regards poetry he expressed his
opinion that Poe was the greatest
American poet, and that Walt Whitman,
if not a poet, was a man who
sounded a strong note, perhaps neither
prose nor poetry, but something of his
own that was “grand, original and
unique.”</p>

<p>During his tour in America Wilde
“happened to find” himself (as he has
himself described it), in Louisville,
Kentucky. The subject he had
selected to speak on was the Mission
of Art in the Nineteenth Century. In
the course of his lecture he had occasion
to quote Keats’ Sonnet on Blue
“as an example of the poet’s delicate
sense of colour-harmonies.” After
the lecture there came round to see
him “a lady of middle age, with a
sweet gentle manner and most musical
voice,” who introduced herself as
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_14" title="14">&nbsp;</a><!--014.png-->
Mrs. Speed, the daughter of George
Keats, and she invited the lecturer to
come and examine the Keats manuscripts
in her possession.</p>

<p>Some months afterwards when
lecturing in California he received a
letter from this lady asking him to
accept the original manuscript of the
sonnet which he had quoted.</p>

<p>Mention must be made of Wilde’s
first play, a drama in blank verse
entitled “Vera, or the Nihilists.” It
had been arranged that, before his departure
for America, this play should
be performed at the Adelphi Theatre,
London, with Mrs. Bernard Beere as
the heroine, on Saturday, December
17th, 1881, but a few weeks before the
date fixed for the first performance,
the author decided to postpone the
production “owing to the state of
political feeling in England.”</p>

<p>On his return to England in 1883
Wilde started on a lecturing tour, the
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_15" title="15">&nbsp;</a><!--015.png-->
first being to the Art Students of the
Royal Academy at their Club in
Golden Square on June 30th. Ten
days later he spoke at Prince’s Hall
on his “Personal Impressions of
America,” and on subsequent occasions
at Margate, Ramsgate and
Southampton. On Monday, July 30th
he lectured at Southport and on
the following Thursday he went to
Liverpool to welcome Mrs. Langtry
on her return from America, and the
same afternoon he left on his second
visit to the States in order to superintend
the rehearsals of “Vera,” which
it had been arranged to produce at
the Union Square Theatre, New York,
on August 20th following. The piece
was not a success&mdash;it was, indeed, the
only failure Wilde had. However,
his next play, which he called his
“Opus Secundum,” also a blank verse
tragedy, had a successful run in
America in 1891. This was “The
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_16" title="16">&nbsp;</a><!--016.png-->
Duchess of Padua,” played by
Lawrence Barrett, under the title of
“Guido Ferranti.” This has not been
seen in England, nor is it even possible
for Wilde’s admirers to read this early
offspring of his pen, for only twenty
copies were printed for acting purposes
in America and of these but one
is known to be in existence, in this
country at least.</p>

<p>An authorised German translation
was made by Max Meyerfeld and the
first performance took place at the
German Theatre in Hamburg about
a year ago. An English version is
advertised from a piratical publisher
in Paris but it is only a translation
from the German back into English.</p>

<p>Towards the end of September 1883
Oscar Wilde returned to England and
immediately began “an all round
lecturing tour,” his first visit being to
Wandsworth Town Hall on Monday,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_17" title="17">&nbsp;</a><!--017.png-->
September 24th, when he delivered to
an enthusiastic audience a lecture on
his “Impressions of America,” which
is contained in the following pages.
He was dressed, a London paper of
the time states, “in ordinary evening
costume, and carried an orange-coloured
silk handkerchief in his breast.
He spoke with great fluency, in a voice
now and then singularly musical, and
only once or twice made a scarcely
perceptible reference to notes.” The
lecture was under the auspices of a
local Literary Society, and the
principle residents of the district
turned out “en masse.” The Chairman,
the Rev. John Park, in introducing
the lecturer, said there were two
reasons why he was glad to welcome
him, and he thought his own feelings
would be shared by the audience.
They must all plead guilty to a feeling
of curiosity, he hoped a laudable one,
to see and hear Mr. Wilde for his own
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_18" title="18">&nbsp;</a><!--018.png-->
sake, and they were also glad to hear
about America&mdash;a country which
many might regard as a kind of
Elysium.</p>

<p>On March 5th in the following year
Wilde lectured at the Crystal Palace
on his American experiences, and on
April 26th he “preached his Gospel
in the East-end,” when it is recorded
that his audience was not only delighted
with his humour, but was
“surprised at the excellent good sense
he talked.” His subject was a plea
in favour of “art for schools,” and
many of his remarks about the English
system of elementary education&mdash;with
its insistence on “the population
of places that no one ever wants to
go to,” and its “familiarity with the
lives of persons who probably never
existed”&mdash;were said to be quite worthy
of Ruskin. A contemporary account
adds that Wilde “showed himself a
pupil of Mr. Ruskin’s, too, in insisting
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_19" title="19">&nbsp;</a><!--019.png-->
on the importance of every child being
taught some handicraft, and in looking
forward to the time when a boy
would rather look at a bird or even
draw it than throw “his customary
stone!”</p>

<p>The British “gamin” has not made
much progress in this respect during
the last twenty years!</p>

<p>His lectures on “Dress,” with the
newspaper correspondence which they
evoked, including some of Oscar
Wilde’s replies in his most characteristic
vein, must be reserved for a future
volume.</p>

Wilde repeated this lecture throughout the States
during his tour. At Rochester, on February 7th, he
met with a most disorderly reception on the part of
the College Students. Two days later Mr. Joaquin
Miller, of St. Louis, wrote to Wilde saying that he
had “read with shame about the behaviour of those
ruffians.” To this Wilde replied, “I thank you for
your chivalrous and courteous letter,” and in the
course of his letter makes a more special attack on
that critic whom he terms “the itinerant libeller of
New England.”</p></div>


<h2>IMPRESSIONS OF AMERICA.</h2>

<p class="first">I fear I cannot picture America as
altogether an Elysium&mdash;perhaps, from
the ordinary standpoint I know but
little about the country. I cannot
give its latitude or longitude; I cannot
compute the value of its dry
goods, and I have no very close
acquaintance with its politics. These
are matters which may not interest
you, and they certainly are not interesting
to me.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck me on
landing in America was that if the
Americans are not the most well-dressed
people in the world, they are
the most comfortably dressed. Men
are seen there with the dreadful
chimney-pot hat, but there are very
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_22" title="22">&nbsp;</a><!--022.png-->
few hatless men; men wear the
shocking swallow-tail coat, but few
are to be seen with no coat at all.
There is an air of comfort in the
appearance of the people which is a
marked contrast to that seen in this
country, where, too often, people are
seen in close contact with rags.</p>

<p>The next thing particularly noticeable
is that everybody seems in a
hurry to catch a train. This is a state
of things which is not favourable to
poetry or romance. Had Romeo or
Juliet been in a constant state of
anxiety about trains, or had their
minds been agitated by the question
of return-tickets, Shakespeare could
not have given us those lovely balcony
scenes which are so full of poetry and
pathos.</p>

<p>America is the noisiest country that
ever existed. One is waked up in the
morning, not by the singing of the
nightingale, but by the steam whistle.
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_23" title="23">&nbsp;</a><!--023.png-->
It is surprising that the sound practical
sense of the Americans does not
reduce this intolerable noise. All Art
depends upon exquisite and delicate
sensibility, and such continual turmoil
must ultimately be destructive of the
musical faculty.</p>

<p>There is not so much beauty to be
found in American cities as in Oxford,
Cambridge, Salisbury or Winchester,
where are lovely relics of a beautiful
age; but still there is a good deal of
beauty to be seen in them now and
then, but only where the American
has not attempted to create it. Where
the Americans have attempted to
produce beauty they have signally
failed. A remarkable characteristic
of the Americans is the manner in
which they have applied science to
modern life.</p>

<p>This is apparent in the most cursory
stroll through New York. In England
an inventor is regarded almost as a
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_24" title="24">&nbsp;</a><!--024.png-->
crazy man, and in too many instances
invention ends in disappointment and
poverty. In America an inventor is
honoured, help is forthcoming, and
the exercise of ingenuity, the application
of science to the work of man,
is there the shortest road to wealth.
There is no country in the world
where machinery is so lovely as in
America.</p>

<p>I have always wished to believe
that the line of strength and the line
of beauty are one. That wish was
realised when I contemplated American
machinery. It was not until I
had seen the water-works at Chicago
that I realised the wonders of
machinery; the rise and fall of the
steel rods, the symmetrical motion of
the great wheels is the most beautifully
rhythmic thing I have ever seen.<a id="Marker_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="marker">[3]</a>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_25" title="25">&nbsp;</a><!--025.png-->
One is impressed in America, but not
favourably impressed, by the inordinate
size of everything. The country
seems to try to bully one into a
belief in its power by its impressive
bigness.</p>

<p>I was disappointed with Niagara&mdash;most
people must be disappointed
with Niagara. Every American bride
is taken there, and the sight of the
stupendous waterfall must be one of
the earliest, if not the keenest, disappointments
in American married
life. One sees it under bad conditions,
very far away, the point of view not
showing the splendour of the water.
To appreciate it really one has to see
it from underneath the fall, and to do
that it is necessary to be dressed in a
yellow oil-skin, which is as ugly as a
mackintosh&mdash;and I hope none of you
ever wears one. It is a consolation to
know, however, that such an artist as
Madame Bernhardt has not only worn
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_26" title="26">&nbsp;</a><!--026.png-->
that yellow, ugly dress, but has been
photographed in it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most beautiful part of
America is the West, to reach which,
however, involves a journey by rail of
six days, racing along tied to an ugly
tin-kettle of a steam engine. I found
but poor consolation for this journey
in the fact that the boys who infest
the cars and sell everything that one
can eat&mdash;or should not eat&mdash;were
selling editions of my poems vilely
printed on a kind of grey blotting
paper, for the low price of ten cents.<a id="Marker_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="marker">[4]</a>
Calling these boys on one side I told
them that though poets like to be
popular they desire to be paid, and
selling editions of my poems without
giving me a profit is dealing a blow
at literature which must have a disastrous
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_27" title="27">&nbsp;</a><!--027.png-->
effect on poetical aspirants.
The invariable reply that they made
was that they themselves made a
profit out of the transaction and that
was all they cared about.</p>

<p>It is a popular superstition that in
America a visitor is invariably
addressed as “Stranger.” I was
never once addressed as “Stranger.”
When I went to Texas I was called
“Captain”; when I got to the centre
of the country I was addressed as
“Colonel,” and, on arriving at the
borders of Mexico, as “General.” On
the whole, however, “Sir,” the old
English method of addressing people
is the most common.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, worth while to note
that what many people call Americanisms
are really old English
expressions which have lingered in
our colonies while they have been
lost in our own country. Many people
imagine that the term “I guess,”
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_28" title="28">&nbsp;</a><!--028.png-->
which is so common in America, is
purely an American expression, but it
was used by John Locke in his work
on “The Understanding,” just as we
now use “I think.”<a id="Marker_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="marker">[5]</a></p>

<p>It is in the colonies, and not in the
mother country, that the old life of
the country really exists. If one wants
to realise what English Puritanism is&mdash;not
at its worst (when it is very
bad), but at its best, and then it is not
very good&mdash;I do not think one can find
much of it in England, but much can
be found about Boston and Massachusetts.
We have got rid of it.
America still preserves it, to be, I
hope, a short-lived curiosity.</p>

<p>San Francisco is a really beautiful
city. China Town, peopled by Chinese
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_29" title="29">&nbsp;</a><!--029.png-->
labourers, is the most artistic town I
have ever come across. The people&mdash;strange,
melancholy Orientals, whom
many people would call common, and
they are certainly very poor&mdash;have
determined that they will have
nothing about them that is not beautiful.
In the Chinese restaurant, where
these navvies meet to have supper in
the evening, I found them drinking
tea out of china cups as delicate as
the petals of a rose-leaf, whereas at the
gaudy hotels I was supplied with a
delf cup an inch and a half thick.
When the Chinese bill was presented
it was made out on rice paper, the
account being done in Indian ink as
fantastically as if an artist had been
etching little birds on a fan.</p>

<p>Salt Lake City contains only two
buildings of note, the chief being the
Tabernacle, which is in the shape of a
soup-kettle. It is decorated by the
only native artist, and he has treated
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_30" title="30">&nbsp;</a><!--030.png-->
religious subjects in the naive spirit
of the early Florentine painters, representing
people of our own day in
the dress of the period side by side
with people of Biblical history who
are clothed in some romantic costume.</p>

<p>The building next in importance is
called the Amelia Palace, in honour
of one of Brigham Young’s wives.
When he died the present president of
the Mormons stood up in the Tabernacle
and said that it had been
revealed to him that he was to have
the Amelia Palace, and that on this
subject there were to be no more
revelations of any kind!</p>

<p>From Salt Lake City one travels
over the great plains of Colorado and
up the Rocky Mountains, on the top
of which is Leadville, the richest city
in the world. It has also got the
reputation of being the roughest, and
every man carries a revolver. I was
told that if I went there they would
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_31" title="31">&nbsp;</a><!--031.png-->
be sure to shoot me or my travelling
manager. I wrote and told them that
nothing that they could do to my travelling
manager would intimidate me.
They are miners&mdash;men working in
metals, so I lectured to them on the
Ethics of Art. I read them passages
from the autobiography of Benvenuto
Cellini and they seemed much delighted.
I was reproved by my hearers
for not having brought him with me.
I explained that he had been dead for
some little time which elicited the
enquiry “Who shot him”? They
afterwards took me to a dancing
saloon where I saw the only rational
method of art criticism I have ever
come across. Over the piano was
printed a <span class="no-wrap">notice:&mdash;</span></p>

<table id="pianist">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td class="left-right">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="top-bottom">&nbsp;</td>
<td class="center">
PLEASE DO NOT SHOOT THE
PIANIST.<br />
HE IS DOING HIS BEST.
</td>
<td class="top-bottom">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td class="left-right">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
<!--032.png-->

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_32" title="32">&nbsp;</a>
The mortality among pianists in
that place is marvellous. Then they
asked me to supper, and having accepted,
I had to descend a mine in a
rickety bucket in which it was impossible
to be graceful. Having got
into the heart of the mountain I had
supper, the first course being whisky,
the second whisky and the third
whisky.</p>

<p>I went to the Theatre to lecture and
I was informed that just before I went
there two men had been seized for
committing a murder, and in that
theatre they had been brought on to
the stage at eight o’clock in the evening,
and then and there tried and
executed before a crowded audience.
But I found these miners very charming
and not at all rough.</p>

<p>Among the more elderly inhabitants
of the South I found a melancholy
tendency to date every event of
importance by the late war. “How
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_33" title="33">&nbsp;</a><!--033.png-->
beautiful the moon is to-night,” I once
remarked to a gentleman who was
standing next to me. “Yes,” was his
reply, “but you should have seen it
before the war.”</p>

<p>So infinitesimal did I find the
knowledge of Art, west of the Rocky
Mountains, that an art patron&mdash;one
who in his day had been a miner&mdash;actually
sued the railroad company for
damages because the plaster cast of
Venus of Milo, which he had imported
from Paris, had been delivered minus
the arms. And, what is more surprising
still, he gained his case and the
damages.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania, with its rocky gorges
and woodland scenery, reminded me
of Switzerland. The prairie reminded
me of a piece of blotting-paper.</p>

<p>The Spanish and French have left
behind them memorials in the beauty
of their names. All the cities that
have beautiful names derive them
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_34" title="34">&nbsp;</a><!--034.png-->
from the Spanish or the French. The
English people give intensely ugly
names to places. One place had such
an ugly name that I refused to lecture
there. It was called Grigsville. Supposing
I had founded a school of
Art there&mdash;fancy “Early Grigsville.”
Imagine a School of Art teaching
“Grigsville Renaissance.”</p>

<p>As for slang I did not hear much
of it, though a young lady who had
changed her clothes after an afternoon
dance did say that “after the heel
kick she shifted her day goods.”</p>

<p>American youths are pale and precocious,
or sallow and supercilious,
but American girls are pretty and
charming&mdash;little oases of pretty unreasonableness
in a vast desert of
practical common-sense.</p>

<p>Every American girl is entitled to
have twelve young men devoted to
her. They remain her slaves and she
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_35" title="35">&nbsp;</a><!--035.png-->
rules them with charming nonchalance.</p>

<p>The men are entirely given to
business; they have, as they say, their
brains in front of their heads. They
are also exceedingly acceptive of new
ideas. Their education is practical.
We base the education of children
entirely on books, but we must give a
child a mind before we can instruct
the mind. Children have a natural antipathy
to books&mdash;handicraft should
be the basis of education. Boys and
girls should be taught to use their
hands to make something, and they
would be less apt to destroy and be
mischievous.</p>

<p>In going to America one learns that
poverty is not a necessary accompaniment
to civilisation. There at any
rate is a country that has no trappings,
no pageants and no gorgeous ceremonies.
I saw only two processions&mdash;one
was the Fire Brigade preceded
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_36" title="36">&nbsp;</a><!--036.png-->
by the Police, the other was the
Police preceded by the Fire Brigade.</p>

<p>Every man when he gets to the age
of twenty-one is allowed a vote, and
thereby immediately acquires his
political education. The Americans
are the best politically educated
people in the world. It is well worth
one’s while to go to a country which
can teach us the beauty of the word
FREEDOM and the value of the
thing LIBERTY.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_37" title="37">&nbsp;</a>
OSCAR WILDE IN AMERICA.</h2>

<p class="first">An interesting account of Oscar
Wilde, at the time of his American
tour, was given in the <i>Lady’s Pictorial</i>
a few weeks after his arrival in New
York, the city which he described as
“one huge Whiteley’s shop.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Abode.</div>

<p>He was interviewed in a room
which was intensely warm
and the sofa on which the poet
reclined was drawn up to the
fire. An immense wolf rug,
bordered with scarlet, was thrown over
it and half-encircled his graceful form
in its warm embrace. Wilde was
wearied. In a languid, half enervated
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_38" title="38">&nbsp;</a><!--038.png-->
manner he gently sipped hot chocolate
from a cup by his side. Occasionally
he inhaled a long, deep whiff from a
smouldering cigarette held lightly in
his white and shapely hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Dress.</div>

<p>He was attired in a smoking
suit of dark brown velvet
faced with lapels of red quilted
silk. The ends of a long dark
necktie floated over the facing like
sea-weed on foam tinged by the dying
sun. Dark brown nether garments,
striped with red up the seam, and
patent leather shoes with light cloth
uppers completed the rest of the poet’s
costume.</p>

<p>His favourite colour is said to have
been something between brown and
green, a tint “that never was on sea
or sky,” and he had a complete suit
made of it. A white walking-stick
which he was in the habit of carrying
was presented to him at the Acropolis
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_39" title="39">&nbsp;</a><!--039.png-->
and was said to have been cut from
the olive groves of the Academia.
Only in the evening was he wont to
don knee breeches, “but evening and
morning alike,” adds his interviewer,
“find him neither more nor less than
a man, and always a perfect gentleman.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">His appearance.</div>

<p>Long masses of dark brown
hair, parted in the middle, fell
in odd curves of beauty over
his broad shoulders. He wore
neither beard nor moustache.
The full, rather sensuous lips, now
pressed close together with momentary
tension, now parted in kindly smile,
showed to perfection the nobility of
his countenance.</p>

<p>A Grecian nose and a well-tinged
flush of health on the poet’s face added
all that was required to make it a
truly remarkable one. The eyes were
large, dark<a id="Marker_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="marker">[6]</a> and ever-changing in
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_40" title="40">&nbsp;</a><!--040.png-->
expression. He was a charming
companion who could tell racy stories
and repeat <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bons mots</i> of those whom
society delighted to honour, and at
the same time could cap quotations
from Greek authors.</p>

<hr />

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#Marker_6" class="label">6.</a>
A French writer, M. Joseph-Renaud, recently
described Wilde’s eyes as being <i>blue</i>, while Lord
Alfred Douglas affirms that they were <i>green</i>.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
